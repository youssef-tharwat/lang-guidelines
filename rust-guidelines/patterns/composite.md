## Composite (Gang of Four) (GOF:composite)

**Composite** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Composite’s great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.
### Files and Folders

Let’s try to understand the Composite pattern with an example of an operating system’s file system. In the file system, there are two types of objects: files and folders. There are cases when files and folders should be treated to be the same way. This is where the Composite pattern comes in handy.

`File` and `Directory` are both of the `trait Component` with a single `search` method. For a file, it will just look into the contents of the file; for a folder, it will go through all files of that folder to find that keyword.

##### **fs/mod.rs**
```rust
mod file;
mod folder;

pub use file::File;
pub use folder::Folder;

pub trait Component {
    fn search(&self, keyword: &str);
}
```

##### **fs/file.rs**
```rust
use super::Component;

pub struct File {
    name: &'static str,
}

impl File {
    pub fn new(name: &'static str) -> Self {
        Self { name }
    }
}

impl Component for File {
    fn search(&self, keyword: &str) {
        println!("Searching for keyword {} in file {}", keyword, self.name);
    }
}
```

##### **fs/folder.rs**
```rust
use super::Component;

pub struct Folder {
    name: &'static str,
    components: Vec<Box<dyn Component>>,
}

impl Folder {
    pub fn new(name: &'static str) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            components: vec![],
        }
    }

    pub fn add(&mut self, component: impl Component + 'static) {
        self.components.push(Box::new(component));
    }
}

impl Component for Folder {
    fn search(&self, keyword: &str) {
        println!(
            "Searching recursively for keyword {} in folder {}",
            keyword, self.name
        );

        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.search(keyword);
        }
    }
}
```

##### **main.rs**
```rust
mod fs;

use fs::{Component, File, Folder};

fn main() {
    let file1 = File::new("File 1");
    let file2 = File::new("File 2");
    let file3 = File::new("File 3");

    let mut folder1 = Folder::new("Folder 1");
    folder1.add(file1);

    let mut folder2 = Folder::new("Folder 2");
    folder2.add(file2);
    folder2.add(file3);
    folder2.add(folder1);

    folder2.search("rose");
}
```

#### Output
```text
Searching recursively for keyword rose in folder Folder 2
Searching for keyword rose in file File 2
Searching for keyword rose in file File 3
Searching recursively for keyword rose in folder Folder 1
Searching for keyword rose in file File 1
