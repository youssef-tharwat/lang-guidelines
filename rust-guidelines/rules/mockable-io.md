# mockable-io

Make I/O, clocks and randomness mockable: accept an injected I/O core, or offer `new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl)` backed by a private enum; no ad-hoc file or network access deep in library code.

**Why:** Hard-to-trigger edge cases become testable.

**Binding in:** libraries (code other packages depend on); a strong recommendation in application-only code.

## I/O and system calls are mockable (M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS)

[Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines](https://microsoft.github.io/rust-guidelines/), MIT.

Any user-facing type doing I/O, or sys calls with side effects, should be mockable to these effects. This includes file and
network access, clocks, entropy sources and seeds, and similar. More generally, any operation that is

- non-deterministic,
- reliant on external state,
- depending on the hardware or the environment,
- is otherwise fragile or not universally reproducible

should be mockable.

> However, this does _not_ mean you should expect there to be unlimited memory available. While it is ok to

This guideline has several implications for libraries, they

- should not perform ad-hoc I/O, i.e., call `read("foo.txt")`
- should not rely on non-mockable I/O and sys calls
- should not create their own I/O or sys call _core_ themselves
- should not offer `MyIoLibrary::default()` constructors

Instead, libraries performing I/O and sys calls should either accept some I/O _core_ that is mockable already, or provide mocking functionality themselves:

```rust
let lib = Library::new_runtime(runtime_io); // mockable I/O functionality passed in
let (lib, mock) = Library::new_mocked(); // supports inherent mocking
```

Libraries supporting inherent mocking should implement it as follows:

```rust
pub struct Library {
    some_core: LibraryCore // Encapsulates syscalls, I/O, ... compare below.
}

impl Library {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl) { ... }
}
```

Behind the scenes, `LibraryCore` is a non-public enum, similar to M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED, that either dispatches
calls to the respective sys call, or to an mocking controller.

```rust
// Dispatches calls either to the operating system, or to a
// mocking controller.
enum LibraryCore {
    Native,

    #[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
    Mocked(mock::MockCtrl)
}

impl LibraryCore {
    // Some function you'd forward to the operating system.
    fn random_u32(&self) {
        match self {
            Self::Native => unsafe { os_random_u32() }
            Self::Mocked(m) => m.random_u32()
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
mod mock {
    // This follows the M-SERVICES-CLONE pattern, so both `LibraryCore` and
    // the user can hold on to the same `MockCtrl` instance.
    pub struct MockCtrl {
        inner: Arc<MockCtrlInner>
    }

    // Implement required logic accordingly, usually forwarding to
    // `MockCtrlInner` below.
    impl MockCtrl {
        pub fn set_next_u32(&self, x: u32) { ... }
        pub fn random_u32(&self) { ... }
    }

    // Contains actual logic, e.g., the next random number we should return.
    struct MockCtrlInner {
        next_call: u32
    }
}
```

Runtime-aware libraries already build on top of the M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED pattern should extend their runtime enum instead:

```rust
enum Runtime {
    #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
    Tokio(tokio::Tokio),

    #[cfg(feature="smol")]
    Smol(smol::Smol)

    #[cfg(feature="test-util")]
    Mock(mock::MockCtrl)
}
```

As indicated above, most libraries supporting mocking should not accept mock controllers, but return them via parameter tuples,
with the first parameter being the library instance, the second the mock controller. This is to prevent state ambiguity if multiple
instances shared a single controller:

```rust
impl Library {
    pub fn new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl) { ... } // good
    pub fn new_mocked_bad(&mut MockCtrl) -> Self { ... } // prone to misuse
}
```


## Design with AI use in mind (M-DESIGN-FOR-AI)

[Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines](https://microsoft.github.io/rust-guidelines/), MIT.

As a general rule, making APIs easier to use for humans also makes them easier to use by AI.
If you follow the guidelines in this book, you should be in good shape.

Rust's strong type system is a boon for agents, as their lack of genuine understanding can often be
counterbalanced by comprehensive compiler checks, which Rust provides in abundance.

With that said, there are a few guidelines which are particularly important to help make AI coding in Rust more effective:

* **Create Idiomatic Rust API Patterns**. The more your APIs, whether public or internal, look and feel like the majority of
Rust code in the world, the better it is for AI. Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html)
along with the guidelines from Library / UX.

* **Provide Thorough Docs**. Agents love good detailed docs. Include docs for all of your modules and public items in your crate.
Assume the reader has a solid, but not expert, level of understanding of Rust, and that the reader understands the standard library.
Follow
[C-CRATE-DOC](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-crate-doc),
[C-FAILURE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-failure),
[C-LINK](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-link), and
M-MODULE-DOCS
M-CANONICAL-DOCS.

* **Provide Thorough Examples**. Your documentation should have directly usable examples, the repository should include more elaborate ones.
Follow
[C-EXAMPLE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-example)
[C-QUESTION-MARK](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-question-mark).

* **Use Strong Types**. Avoid [primitive obsession](https://refactoring.guru/smells/primitive-obsession) by using strong types with strict well-documented semantics.
Follow
[C-NEWTYPE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-newtype).

* **Make Your APIs Testable**. Design APIs which allow your customers to test their use of your API in unit tests. This might involve introducing some mocks, fakes,
or cargo features. AI agents need to be able to iterate quickly to prove that the code they are writing that calls your API is working
correctly.

* **Ensure Test Coverage**. Your own code should have good test coverage over observable behavior.
This enables agents to work in a mostly hands-off mode when refactoring.
