### What it does

This rule prevents duplicate props in JSX elements.

### Why is this bad?

Having duplicate props in a JSX element is most likely a mistake.
Creating JSX elements with duplicate props can cause unexpected behavior in your application.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<App a a />;
<App foo={2} bar baz foo={3} />;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<App a />;
<App bar baz foo={3} />;
```

### Differences from eslint-plugin-react

This rule does not support the `ignoreCase` option. Props with different cases are
considered distinct and will not be flagged as duplicates (e.g., `<App foo Foo />`
is allowed). This is intentional, as props are case-sensitive in JSX.
