### What it does

Disallow passing multiple arguments to scoped slots.

### Why is this bad?

Users have to use the arguments in fixed order and cannot omit the ones they don't need.
e.g. if you have a slot that passes in 5 arguments but the user actually only need the last 2 of them,
they will have to declare all 5 just to use the last 2.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```vue
<script>
export default {
  render(h) {
    var children = this.$scopedSlots.default(foo, bar);
    var children = this.$scopedSlots.default(...foo);
  },
};
</script>
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```vue
<script>
export default {
  render(h) {
    var children = this.$scopedSlots.default();
    var children = this.$scopedSlots.default(foo);
    var children = this.$scopedSlots.default({ foo, bar });
  },
};
</script>
```
