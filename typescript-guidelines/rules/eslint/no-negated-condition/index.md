### What it does

Disallow negated conditions.

### Why is this bad?

Negated conditions are more difficult to understand. Code can be made more readable by inverting the condition.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
if (!a) {
  doSomethingC();
} else {
  doSomethingB();
}

!a ? doSomethingC() : doSomethingB();
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
if (a) {
  doSomethingB();
} else {
  doSomethingC();
}

a ? doSomethingB() : doSomethingC();
```
