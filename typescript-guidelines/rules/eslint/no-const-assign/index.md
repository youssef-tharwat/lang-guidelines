### What it does

Disallow reassigning `const` variables.

### Why is this bad?

We cannot modify variables that are declared using the `const` keyword,
as it will raise a runtime error.

Note that this rule is not necessary for TypeScript
code, as TypeScript will already catch this as an error.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
const a = 0;
a = 1;

const b = 0;
b += 1;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
const a = 0;
console.log(a);

var b = 0;
b += 1;
```
