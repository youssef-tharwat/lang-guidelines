### What it does

Disallow unreachable code after `return`, `throw`, `continue`, and `break` statements.

This rule can be disabled for TypeScript code if `allowUnreachableCode: false` is configured
in the `tsconfig.json`, as the TypeScript compiler enforces this check.

### Why is this bad?

Unreachable code after a `return`, `throw`, `continue`, or `break` statement can never be run.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
function foo() {
  return 2;
  console.log("this will never be executed");
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
function foo() {
  console.log("this will be executed");
  return 2;
}
```
