### What it does

Reports use of an exported name as the locally imported name of a default export.
This happens when an imported default export is assigned a name that conflicts
with a named export from the same module.

### Why is this bad?

Using a named export's identifier for a default export can cause confusion
and errors in understanding which value is being imported. It also reduces
code clarity, making it harder for other developers to understand the intended
imports.

### Examples

Given

```javascript
// foo.js
export default "foo";
export const bar = true;
```

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
// Invalid: using exported name 'bar' as the identifier for default export.
import bar from "./foo.js";
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
// Valid: correctly importing default export with a non-conflicting name.
import foo from "./foo.js";
```

### Differences compared to `eslint-plugin-import`

If you see differences between this rule implementation and the original `eslint-plugin-import`
rule, please note that the behavior may differ in certain cases due to differences in how
module resolution is implemented and configured.

For example, the original rule may require additional resolver configuration to handle certain
imports, especially when TypeScript paths are used or in monorepo setups with multiple
`tsconfig.json` files.
