### What it does

Disallows assignment to `exports`.

### Why is this bad?

Directly using `exports = {}` can lead to confusion and potential bugs
because it reassigns the `exports` object, which may break module
exports. It is more predictable and clearer to use `module.exports`
directly or in conjunction with `exports`.

This rule is aimed at disallowing `exports = {}`, but allows
`module.exports = exports = {}` to avoid conflict with `n/exports-style`
rule's `allowBatchAssign` option.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
exports = {};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
module.exports.foo = 1;
exports.bar = 2;
module.exports = {};

// allows `exports = {}` if along with `module.exports =`
module.exports = exports = {};
exports = module.exports = {};
```
