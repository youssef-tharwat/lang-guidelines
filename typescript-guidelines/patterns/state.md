## State (Gang of Four) (GOF:state)

[Design Patterns in TypeScript (refactoring.guru)](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/typescript/example), CC BY-SA 4.0.

**State** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.

The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.
**Usage examples:** The State pattern is commonly used in TypeScript to convert massive `switch`-base state machines into objects.

**Identification:** State pattern can be recognized by methods that change their behavior depending on the objects’ state, controlled externally.

### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **State** design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

*   What classes does it consist of?
*   What roles do these classes play?
*   In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

##### **index.ts:** Conceptual example
```typescript
/**
 * The Context defines the interface of interest to clients. It also maintains a
 * reference to an instance of a State subclass, which represents the current
 * state of the Context.
 */
class Context {
    /**
     * @type {State} A reference to the current state of the Context.
     */
    private state: State;

    constructor(state: State) {
        this.transitionTo(state);
    }

    /**
     * The Context allows changing the State object at runtime.
     */
    public transitionTo(state: State): void {
        console.log(`Context: Transition to ${(<any>state).constructor.name}.`);
        this.state = state;
        this.state.setContext(this);
    }

    /**
     * The Context delegates part of its behavior to the current State object.
     */
    public request1(): void {
        this.state.handle1();
    }

    public request2(): void {
        this.state.handle2();
    }
}

/**
 * The base State class declares methods that all Concrete State should
 * implement and also provides a backreference to the Context object, associated
 * with the State. This backreference can be used by States to transition the
 * Context to another State.
 */
abstract class State {
    protected context: Context;

    public setContext(context: Context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public abstract handle1(): void;

    public abstract handle2(): void;
}

/**
 * Concrete States implement various behaviors, associated with a state of the
 * Context.
 */
class ConcreteStateA extends State {
    public handle1(): void {
        console.log('ConcreteStateA handles request1.');
        console.log('ConcreteStateA wants to change the state of the context.');
        this.context.transitionTo(new ConcreteStateB());
    }

    public handle2(): void {
        console.log('ConcreteStateA handles request2.');
    }
}

class ConcreteStateB extends State {
    public handle1(): void {
        console.log('ConcreteStateB handles request1.');
    }

    public handle2(): void {
        console.log('ConcreteStateB handles request2.');
        console.log('ConcreteStateB wants to change the state of the context.');
        this.context.transitionTo(new ConcreteStateA());
    }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */
const context = new Context(new ConcreteStateA());
context.request1();
context.request2();
```

##### **Output.txt:** Execution result
```text
Context: Transition to ConcreteStateA.
ConcreteStateA handles request1.
ConcreteStateA wants to change the state of the context.
Context: Transition to ConcreteStateB.
ConcreteStateB handles request2.
ConcreteStateB wants to change the state of the context.
Context: Transition to ConcreteStateA.
```
