## Builder (Gang of Four) (GOF:builder)

[Design Patterns in TypeScript (refactoring.guru)](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/typescript/example), CC BY-SA 4.0.

**Builder** is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesn’t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.
**Usage examples:** The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in TypeScript world. It’s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

**Identification:** The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. Builder methods often support chaining (for example, `someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()`).

### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Builder** design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

*   What classes does it consist of?
*   What roles do these classes play?
*   In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

##### **index.ts:** Conceptual example
```typescript
/**
 * The Builder interface specifies methods for creating the different parts of
 * the Product objects.
 */
interface Builder {
    producePartA(): void;
    producePartB(): void;
    producePartC(): void;
}

/**
 * The Concrete Builder classes follow the Builder interface and provide
 * specific implementations of the building steps. Your program may have several
 * variations of Builders, implemented differently.
 */
class ConcreteBuilder1 implements Builder {
    private product: Product1;

    /**
     * A fresh builder instance should contain a blank product object, which is
     * used in further assembly.
     */
    constructor() {
        this.reset();
    }

    public reset(): void {
        this.product = new Product1();
    }

    /**
     * All production steps work with the same product instance.
     */
    public producePartA(): void {
        this.product.parts.push('PartA1');
    }

    public producePartB(): void {
        this.product.parts.push('PartB1');
    }

    public producePartC(): void {
        this.product.parts.push('PartC1');
    }

    /**
     * Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for
     * retrieving results. That's because various types of builders may create
     * entirely different products that don't follow the same interface.
     * Therefore, such methods cannot be declared in the base Builder interface
     * (at least in a statically typed programming language).
     *
     * Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder instance
     * is expected to be ready to start producing another product. That's why
     * it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end of the
     * `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory, and
     * you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset call from the
     * client code before disposing of the previous result.
     */
    public getProduct(): Product1 {
        const result = this.product;
        this.reset();
        return result;
    }
}

/**
 * It makes sense to use the Builder pattern only when your products are quite
 * complex and require extensive configuration.
 *
 * Unlike in other creational patterns, different concrete builders can produce
 * unrelated products. In other words, results of various builders may not
 * always follow the same interface.
 */
class Product1 {
    public parts: string[] = [];

    public listParts(): void {
        console.log(`Product parts: ${this.parts.join(', ')}\n`);
    }
}

/**
 * The Director is only responsible for executing the building steps in a
 * particular sequence. It is helpful when producing products according to a
 * specific order or configuration. Strictly speaking, the Director class is
 * optional, since the client can control builders directly.
 */
class Director {
    private builder: Builder;

    /**
     * The Director works with any builder instance that the client code passes
     * to it. This way, the client code may alter the final type of the newly
     * assembled product.
     */
    public setBuilder(builder: Builder): void {
        this.builder = builder;
    }

    /**
     * The Director can construct several product variations using the same
     * building steps.
     */
    public buildMinimalViableProduct(): void {
        this.builder.producePartA();
    }

    public buildFullFeaturedProduct(): void {
        this.builder.producePartA();
        this.builder.producePartB();
        this.builder.producePartC();
    }
}

/**
 * The client code creates a builder object, passes it to the director and then
 * initiates the construction process. The end result is retrieved from the
 * builder object.
 */
function clientCode(director: Director) {
    const builder = new ConcreteBuilder1();
    director.setBuilder(builder);

    console.log('Standard basic product:');
    director.buildMinimalViableProduct();
    builder.getProduct().listParts();

    console.log('Standard full featured product:');
    director.buildFullFeaturedProduct();
    builder.getProduct().listParts();

    // Remember, the Builder pattern can be used without a Director class.
    console.log('Custom product:');
    builder.producePartA();
    builder.producePartC();
    builder.getProduct().listParts();
}

const director = new Director();
clientCode(director);
```

```text
Standard basic product:
Product parts: PartA1

Standard full featured product:
Product parts: PartA1, PartB1, PartC1

Custom product:
Product parts: PartA1, PartC1
```
